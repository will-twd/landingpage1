This project is a basic landing page made as part of the Odin Project.

Having previously gone through codecademys frontend course (this was a while ago) I have actually done this before!
In fact I did it without having a design to reference, no wonder I got so frustrated back then!

I've revised CSS flexbox thoroughly as this gave me a major headache the first time round.

I may also see if I can remember how to make it responisve with media queries etc, though this is not required
for the assignment.

Lets see how I get on!
