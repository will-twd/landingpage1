This project is a basic landing page made as part of the Odin Project.

Really happy with how this turned out, I've managed to get the layout quite close to the reference image Odin Provided! I also think it scales well when expanded to full screen (on desktop).

If I was to spend more time on the project I would make sure to add some media queries and responsive design so it scales properly for mobile. However as Odin covers this later I will finish here.

I'm glad I spent some time getting used to flexbox before the project. When I have worked with CSS in the past it gave me a major headache! 
Now I have a better understanding of how to use it. This project was a great oppurtunity for practice and I can see what a powerful tool it is.

I have also learned a lot about GIT and made an effort to use this as much as possible throughout.
